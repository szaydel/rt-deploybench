rt-deploybench
==============

This is primarily a script used to bootstrap vdbench and run predefined tests on a system, prior to it being delpoyed. Essentially this is meant to be used as part of a standard validation suite prior to system becoming production.

Chances are good this will not work for the general public, because the script was written specifically for RackTop systems. However, you may find that it is easily adapted for similar purposes in other environments.
